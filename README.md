# Node w/ Speakeasy (Two Factor Authentication/2FA)

## Overview
Made following [Brad Traversy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQya9i6czhM&t=180s) and paritally based of [this LogRocket article](https://blog.logrocket.com/implementing-two-factor-authentication-using-speakeasy/). 

It should be noted that no password has been implemented *(obviously something you would add in)* to keep things simple.
